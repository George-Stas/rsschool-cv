## About Myself
I studied at the Belarusian National Technical University as an engineer-economist. Now I work at the company, but I really want to change this place of work. That's why I started studying programming and I didn't notice how I began to like it. To realize my dream, I signed up for a Frontend developer course from RS School. I hope to achieve impressive results in programming, because I consider myself purposeful, I learn and adapt quickly, I can spend a long time doing my favorite thing.
